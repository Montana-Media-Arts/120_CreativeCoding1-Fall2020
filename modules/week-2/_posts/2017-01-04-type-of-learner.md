This section is all about how do we learn best.  Why do I put this in here now?  I want to us to better understand how optimally learn (which can be different for everyone) and then find the best way to achieve our goals.  When I took this learning quiz, I found found that I was equally a visual and an auditory learner.  This is important because it means I learn best by watching and hearing other perform tasks.  Then, I am able to master things more easily.  How do you best learn?  Let's find out!

Take the quiz below and keep track of your answers. You will turn these in as well.
