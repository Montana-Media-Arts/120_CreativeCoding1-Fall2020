This week we are going to look at websites.  Websites are all around us, but so are other mediums. How can we integrate traditional websites With social media sites like Instagram and Facebook?  What about templates such as WordPress and Drupal? How do they fit within this?  Do we need to learn HTML?  

That's our discussion topic for the week, so go over to Moodle and share your thoughts.

One of the things I like are examples of good and bad websites.  Let's look at some good ones.
