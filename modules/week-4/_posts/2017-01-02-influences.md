# Influences

This week we are going to start by discussing who has helped us along the way.  Often in our society, we are proud of our independence, and you should be. However, I am guessing that somewhere along the way, someone was there for you to help pick you up, guide you, or provide encouragement right when you needed it.  Who was that person?  What did they do for you?  Influential people is the discussion topic for the week, so jot down some notes and share this in the discussion section of the class.
