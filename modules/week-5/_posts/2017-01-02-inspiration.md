# What Inspires Us <br />

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Last week we looked at influences as well as mobile applications and how they have shaped us and how we use mobile technologies to develop who we are and who we influence. This week we will shift our focus to inspiration. As artists, game designers, developers, and interactive media artists, inspiration is all around us. Maybe it's our environment, other artists, a particular game, a website, or another creator.  We will discuss what inspires us to create and why.
