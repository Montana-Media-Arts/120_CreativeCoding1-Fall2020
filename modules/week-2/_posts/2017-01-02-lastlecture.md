# The Last Lecture

In this video, we are going to watch Randy Pausch talk about that which he has overcome and I want you to reflect upon your own life too.  At first, you may think that this video is too long or tedious to watch, but it is worth it I promise.  Take a look and let me know what you think.

How did it make you feel?  Could you relate?  Take note of your thoughts on this.  I want you put those thoughts into writing this week.  This is part of your homework.
