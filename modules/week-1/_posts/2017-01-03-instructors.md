## Michael Cassens

I am the professor delivering this course. I am also the instructor of record for this course. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, please come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey of beginning to code!

Please feel free to leverage my office hours, email, text messages or phone calls to find me. I would love it if each and everyone of you who are in Missoula could come by sometime to introduce yourself. For those of you who are distance learners, please consider sending me an email about yourself, along with something to help me get to know you better, like your own website, or links to your creative work.  You are also welcome to set up a Zoom meeting with me and we can get to know one another better that way as well.

I would also like to say that I am first and foremost a teacher, so I will work to respond to your questions and problems as quickly as I can. E-mail is one of the best ways to get a hold of me. I check my e-mail throughout the day so you should hear back from . My office hours are another way to get help from me. They are posted and updated in the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab of this website.
