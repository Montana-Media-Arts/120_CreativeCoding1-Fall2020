# Additional Tags

<!-- video -->
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Two tags inside the `<html>` tag, but do not appear on the page are the title tag and the head.  The first is the `<title>` tag, and the second is the `<head>` tag.  They both exist above body tag, and they serve two very distinct purposes.

1. title - the text that goes between the title tags show up in the tab or the title bar of the browser.
2. head - the head tag contains items like included files.  We will examine these as time goes on.  

Here's an example of the head and the title tags.

```html
<html>
    <title>My first page</title>
    <head>
        <!-- this is a comment -->
        <!-- we will put stuff in here later -->
    </head>
    <body>
        This is a some random text
    </body>
</htmL>
```

There are several other tags that we use for display purposes.

1. ol - Use this tag to create an ordered list.  
2. ul - Use this tag to create an unordered list
3. li - this tag must be used with the ol and ul to make the list items appear

It looks like the following:

```html
<html>
    <title>My first page</title>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Oranges</li>
            <li>Grapes</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Dogs</li>
            <li>Cats</li>
            <li>Hedgehogs</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

Try these tags in the section below to ensure that you see the ordered and the unordered list.

What else can we do?  If I want to display images, there is a unique tag for that.  It's the `<img>` tag.  Using this tag, we can view images. Let's look at an example, and then I will explain it to you.

```html
<html>
    <title>My first page</title>
    <body>
        <img src="myPicture.jpg" />
    </body>
</htmL>
```

What did I do? Yikes!  What I did was add what is called an `attribute` to the `<img>` tag.  This attribute is where we store the location of the image.  It can be on your computer or reference a picture online.  Pretty cool, huh?  There are more attributes if we want to change the size of the image as well.  They are `height` and `width`.

Try this example out and see if it works:

```html
<html>
    <title>My first page</title>
    <body>
        <img src="myPicture.jpg" height='200' width='200'/>
    </body>
</htmL>
```
