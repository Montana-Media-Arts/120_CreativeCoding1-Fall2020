My hope is that at some point you have heard of code.org.  It made a big splash in the news when it first came out because its whole goal was to show the world that anyone could learn to write code.  Through the Hour of Code, they had celebrities try it out and get people excited about the possiblilities.  In the six years since its release, it has been widely successful and adopted in many schools ranging from elementary to college.

So, we are going to try it out too!  There are courses using Star Wars, Princesses, Minecraft and others.  However, as artists, we are going to focus a more creative version of the code.org. So, we are going to use the Dance Party for our medium.  C'mon it'll be fun!  

### Dance Party

This introductory module shows us what is possible when we learn how to write a little code. It uses a visual language to make our characters do what we want them to do.  Why do we start here?  So we can focus on the the **logic** and without having to worry about the syntax too much.  Below is the introductory video from Code.org.

Once you are done, don't forget to save your certificate.  Just take a screen shot and save that image. You will turn that in for your homework. On windows, just press the `PrtScn` button.  On the Mac,  `Command+Shift+3`

### Artist Lab

Finally, we are going to do some more exploration using Artist Lab.  

Go to <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/artist/stage/1/puzzle/1" target="_new">Artist Lab</a>

go through the tutorial and then create something at the end. Please take a screen shot of that creation and then save that with your certificate from the previous exercise.
