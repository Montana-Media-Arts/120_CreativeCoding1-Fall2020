Creating apps is a fun way to write code and then share it with your friends. So, that's one of the things we are going to do this week.  

First go to <a href="https://code.org/educate/applab" target="_new">App Lab</a> with Code.org. 

Click on the `Try it out` button.  You may have to sign in with a Google account, or there are other choices too.

Once you are in, you should see a picture of the Mobile Device, the Toolbox, and the Workspace.  Watch the video below, and I will give you a short explanation of each of these.
